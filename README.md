# Java & Containerized Content Creator Application

This is a project to make a subway-surfer-tiktok media creator. The idea is that the program scrapes the first paragraph from a wikipedia page. Then turns it into a text-to-speech and video using stock footage and AI tools.

Thing I want to learn during creating my project:
web scraper, text-to-speech integration, and proficiency in using containers.
